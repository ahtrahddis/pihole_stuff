Files and stuff from my Pihole implementation.

I am currently using:

- Odroid C1+
- Armbian Ubuntu xenial: https://dl.armbian.com/odroidc1/Ubuntu_xenial_default.7z
- Pihole

In order to install Pihole I did the following:

wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
bash basic-install.sh
